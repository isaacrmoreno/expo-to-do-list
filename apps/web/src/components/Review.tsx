        "I struggle with finding the right tool as a to-do list. I've used notes, reminders app, daily planners and the traditional pen to paper list. This is by far the best thing i've encountered and so happy it has been created. Super easy to use and gets straight to the point. I was blown away with how something so simple was exactly what I needed.",

        "Quail is as easy as it gets to use. No sign in, no extra features just a simple to do list. Plus their aren't any annoying ads or pop ups to subscribe. More apps need to adopt this minimal aesthetic and not bombard users with gimmicky features. Quail is my go to to do list app from now on ðŸ¤˜",
