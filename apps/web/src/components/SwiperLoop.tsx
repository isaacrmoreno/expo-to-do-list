This is by far the best thing i've encountered and so happy it has been created. Super easy to use and gets straight to the point. I was blown away with how something so simple was exactly what I needed.",

More apps need to adopt this minimal aesthetic and not bombard users with gimmicky features. Quail is my go to to do list app from now on ðŸ¤˜",
